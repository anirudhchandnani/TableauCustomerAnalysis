This project combines Python and Tableau to analyze sales data from an e-commerce global superstore, employing clustering techniques to segment customers and creating interactive dashboards for comprehensive insights. Beginning with data cleaning and preparation in Python, the dataset underwent rigorous checks for structure, missing values, and consistency in categorical features like City, State, and Product Name. Ambiguous country names were standardized using external data sources, and irrelevant columns were removed to streamline analysis. Customer segmentation utilized the RFM framework for clustering based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, with outlier detection and scaling for optimal clustering results. Using K-means and Agglomerative algorithms, we identified two distinct customer clusters, supported by metrics such as silhouette scores and visualization tools. Data was transferred to MySQL for storage, and Tableau was connected via ODBC drivers to create interactive dashboards. The sales dashboard visualized metrics like sales performance, profitability, regional distribution, and monthly trends using diverse chart types. The customer segmentation dashboard provided insights into cluster characteristics, enabling targeted strategies. Overall, this project aims to enhance decision-making through data-driven insights into sales performance and customer behavior within the global superstore environment.
